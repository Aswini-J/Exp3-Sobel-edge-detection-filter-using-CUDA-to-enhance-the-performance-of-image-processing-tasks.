<h1> <align=center> Sobel edge detection filter using CUDA </h3>
  Implement Sobel edge detection filtern using GPU.</h3>
Experiment Details:
  
## AIM:
  The Sobel operator is a popular edge detection method that computes the gradient of the image intensity at each pixel. It uses convolution with two kernels to determine the gradient in both the x and y directions. This lab focuses on utilizing CUDA to parallelize the Sobel filter implementation for efficient processing of images.

Code Overview: You will work with the provided CUDA implementation of the Sobel edge detection filter. The code reads an input image, applies the Sobel filter in parallel on the GPU, and writes the result to an output image.
## EQUIPMENTS REQUIRED:
Hardware – PCs with NVIDIA GPU & CUDA NVCC
Google Colab with NVCC Compiler
CUDA Toolkit and OpenCV installed.
A sample image for testing.

## PROCEDURE:
Tasks: 
a. Modify the Kernel:

Update the kernel to handle color images by converting them to grayscale before applying the Sobel filter.
Implement boundary checks to avoid reading out of bounds for pixels on the image edges.

b. Performance Analysis:

Measure the performance (execution time) of the Sobel filter with different image sizes (e.g., 256x256, 512x512, 1024x1024).
Analyze how the block size (e.g., 8x8, 16x16, 32x32) affects the execution time and output quality.

c. Comparison:

Compare the output of your CUDA Sobel filter with a CPU-based Sobel filter implemented using OpenCV.
Discuss the differences in execution time and output quality.
